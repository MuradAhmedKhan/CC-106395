# What is Java Compiler OR Interpreter? #
We can say that java behaves as compiler as well as interpreter because the work of java compiler callled javac is to convert the program into bytecode after then the here is the function of JVM (Java Virtual Machine) which interprets and execute at runtime. That's why we include java in both compiler and interpreter as well.
