## Project Description ##
Replace this text with the description of your project. Tell what the project was about. What you aimed to deliver in the project.

##Sample Language Used ##
Replace this text with the desription of what was your sample language. You may include some code examples of loops, if and simple statements
```C++
#include <some code examples.h>
printf("This is a loop example!");
for(int i=0; i<10 ; i++){
    printf("Please Allah Forgive me. I cheated in exam while fasting!");
}
```
###Lexical Specification###
Replace this text with a complete lexical specification of your selected programming language.

###Grammar###
Replace this text with a complete GRAMMAR of your selected language


###Approach###
How you handled the tasks that were given? How your program works? What will you have to do to translate the program to C# code?

##Problems Faced##
There are lots of problems that we faced, lots of new platforms, new things, new languages that we never learn before. So, we decided to solve those problems by research, learn about that problems and language.

### Problem 1: I don't know how to Code in Mini Java ###
Me and my group partner both of us didn't have any idea of mini Java before this course. We are familiar with C#. We mostly do code in C# language so that made a problem that we faced.

### Problem 2: My Parents forced me for a degree ###
If you were not able to convince your parents not to force you for degree and now you are doing it for them, then do it with your best effort and not half heartedly. There is no point wasting this time with finding a loop hole here and there and passing courses without actually learning anything.

###Problem 3: My girlfriend's father won't let me marry her unless I've a degree###
Replace the heading and text of this to mention the problem you have faced in your project.
