## Project Description ##
Replace this text with the description of your project. Tell what the project was about. What you aimed to deliver in the project.

## Sample Code of Mini Java ##

### Functions in Mini java ###

```
   class PrintHello {
        public static void main() {
                System.out.println("Simple Program for hello world");
        }
    }

```


### Calling Function in Mini Java ###

```
parseA() {
    if (theToken == 'a') {accept('a'); accept('a');}
    else error()
}

parseStart() {
    if (theToken=='a') {
       accept('a');
       parseA();
    }
```

### Variables Declaration in Mini Java ###

```
   int A = 7; //This the variable initialization of integer type

```

### If/else Statements ### 

```
    if (theString == 'a') {accept('a');}

```

### Arrays ###

```
    int [] a;   //local variable 
    a = new int [76];
    a[0] = 7;
    a[2] = 77;
```

### For Loops ###
```
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  System.out.println(i);
}
```



###Lexical Specification###
Replace this text with a complete lexical specification of your selected programming language.

###Grammar###
## **Grammar Notations in MiniJava:** ##
```
IDENTIFIER ::=  LETTER [[ LETTER ]]*
NUMERAL ::=  DIGIT [[ DIGIT ]]*
OPERATOR ::= + | ==
LETTER ::= A | B | C | ... | Z
NUMERAL ::= 0 | 1 | ... | 9

Token
Lexeme
Value        {for integer tokens}
ValueR       {for real tokens}
Literal      {for quoted strings}


```

### Approach ###

New Approach that we learn are gievn below:
- Linux Terminal
- Flex
- YACC
- Mini Java

## Problems Faced ##
There are lots of problems that we faced, lots of new platforms, new things, new languages that we never learn before. So, we decided to solve those problems by research, learn about that problems and language.

### Problem 1: I don't know how to Code in Mini Java ###
Me and my group partner both of us didn't have any idea of mini Java before this course. We are familiar with C#. We mostly do code in C# language so that made a problem that we faced.

### Problem 2: My Parents forced me for a degree ###
If you were not able to convince your parents not to force you for degree and now you are doing it for them, then do it with your best effort and not half heartedly. There is no point wasting this time with finding a loop hole here and there and passing courses without actually learning anything.

###Problem 3: My girlfriend's father won't let me marry her unless I've a degree###
Replace the heading and text of this to mention the problem you have faced in your project.

##References##
- Mention and add [links](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), references, books, research papers, code samples, you used to get help in the project.
- Use bullets like this.
- Mention all references. Plagiarism will not be tolerated.
- You see markdown is not that difficult.
- You are CS students not some tom harry from BBA SHE-B-A :-).
- You can and must learn to use markdown and Github.
- All future project development will be down in something similar to GITHUB
